sbdprivacylib - Description
===================================

``privlib`` is a Python software package to manage privacy risk and discrimination in tabular and sequential data.
It comprises methods to assess privacy risk and discrimination, anonymize data according to various algorithms and mitigate discrimination.

If you would like to test ``privlib`` functionalities without installing it on your machine consider using the
preconfigured Jupyter Hub instances offered by the H2020 `SoBigData++`_ research project.
